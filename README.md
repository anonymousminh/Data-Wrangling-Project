# Data-Wrangling-Project

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle which is called "Premier League Standings 22 Seasons (2000-2022)" to analyze the offenses of Premier League teams for a decade.
My report for this project is in the docs file and I got the code in Jupyter Notebook. Please check it out and give some feedbacks.

Thanks.
